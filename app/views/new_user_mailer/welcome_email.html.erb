<%= @athlete_first_name %>, <br /><br />


   I really appreciate you joining us at Backyard Lion, and I know you'll love it when you see how easy it is to connect with college coaches. <br />

We built Backyard Lion to help athletes connect with college coaches, and I hope that we can help you play <%= @athlete_sport %> collegiately after you leave <%= @athlete_high_school %>. <br />

If you wouldn't mind, I'd love it if you answered one quick question: why did you sign up for Backyard Lion? <br />

I'm asking because knowing what made you sign up is really helpful for us in making sure that we're delivering on what our users want. Just hit "reply" and let me know. <br />

By the way, over the next couple weeks, we'll be sending you a few more emails to help you connect to coaches. We'll be sharing some tips, checking in with you and showing you how some of our athletes use Backyard Lion to connect with more recruiters. <br /><br />


Most sincerely,<br />
Devan<br />
CEO, Backyard Lion<br />
