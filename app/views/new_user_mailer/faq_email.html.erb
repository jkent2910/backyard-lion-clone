Hi, <%= @athlete_first_name %>,<br /><br />

I hope all is well in <%= @athlete_city %>! <br /><br />

To help you get the most out of Backyard Lion, I want to address three common questions on how to stand out and make a great impression after you do. <br /><br />

QUESTION: How do I generate exposure by myself? <br /><br />

Backyard Lion offers several channels to help you get your name out for <%= @athlete_sport %>. The easiest way to access these channels is to complete the 'Stand-Out Challenge' featured in the navigation; which is a step-by-step process that helps generate exposure. <br /> <br />

QUESTION: How do I make a great first impression (your profile strength)? <br /><br />

Your profile has a profile strength algorithm to give you a good idea of the quality of your profile as a <%= @athlete_sport %> athlete. The algorithm is comprised of two components. <br />
The number of completed fields on in your 'Edit Profile'. <br />
The number of recommendations and endorsements your profile contains. <br /><br />
QUESTION: How do college coaches hear about me? <br />

Backyard Lion offers several promotions through channels like newsletters, email and social media. As an athlete, you can also generate exposure on your own in two ways. <br />
Create an athlete profile and submit interest to <%= @athlete_sport %> teams. The submission sends a notification to the coaches of the team, who can then choose to pursue you. <br />
College recruiters use their search parameters (e.g. Search for <%= @athlete_sport %> athletes from <%= @athlete_city %>) to narrow in on you and engage with you if they feel fit is right. Note: your profile completeness is important in order to show up in these search results. <br /><br />

I hope this helps you in your pursue to play <%= @athlete_sport %> in college. <br /><br />

Most sincerely, <br /><br />
